<p>Burp2Slack extension matches all BurpSuite traffics (Intruder, Repeater, Proxy and Scanner) based on "any" of the user input conditions such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the input string exists in the response body</li>
	<li>If the input string exists in the response headers</li>
	<li>If the response content-length is (equal, greater than, less than or doesn't equal) the user input content length</li>
	<li>If the input status code matches the response one</li>
</ul>
<p>When one of the above conditions met, then it pushes a notification to either a Slack channel or Custom server. The notification message is customized and can be edited/formatted by the user to get the met "condition/s" and/or the HTTP response body that includes the conditions.</p>
